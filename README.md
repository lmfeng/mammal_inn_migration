##Data and code for the paper
Cortical arealization of interneurons defines shared and distinct molecular programs in developing human and macaque brains
##Introduction
We curated ours and publicly available scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets from developing human and macaque telencephalon to characterize the interneuron maturation and regional specification along migration, and surveyed the transcriptome of over 700,000 interneurons. The collected brains spanned from embryonic weeks to late-fetal stages, incorporating 21 time points ranging from 7 gestational weeks (GWs) to 33 GWs.
